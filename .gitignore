# We might want to keep output/ for demo purposes if it's not sensitive, 
# but usually we ignore build artifacts.
# Assuming user wants to deploy "static pages", we might want to track output/ 
# or use a different folder for deployment.
# For now, let's IGNORE output by default to be safe, unless specifically added.
